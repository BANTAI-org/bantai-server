-- 003: identity integrity for self-registered drivers
--
-- Closes three gaps found when cross-checking the driver registration flow
-- (DriverService / DriverRepository) against init + 003:
--
--   1. Name CHECKs depended on the database's LC_CTYPE. [[:alpha:]] only
--      matches ASCII letters under the C locale, so a name like "Peña"
--      that the API accepts would be rejected here.
--   2. Nothing stopped one social identity, or one mobile number, from
--      backing two accounts.
--   3. email was UNIQUE across ALL rows, including soft-deleted ones, so a
--      deleted driver could never register again with the same address;
--      it was also case-sensitive.
--
-- PRE-FLIGHT: steps 2 and 3 fail (by design) if the data already violates
-- them. Run these first; every query should return zero rows.
--
--   SELECT lower(email), count(*) FROM user_account
--     WHERE deleted_at IS NULL GROUP BY 1 HAVING count(*) > 1;
--   SELECT m_number, count(*) FROM user_account
--     WHERE m_number IS NOT NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL
--     GROUP BY 1 HAVING count(*) > 1;
--   SELECT auth_provider, provider_id, count(*) FROM user_account
--     WHERE provider_id IS NOT NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL
--     GROUP BY 1, 2 HAVING count(*) > 1;

-- ============================================================
-- 1. LOCALE-INDEPENDENT NAME CHECKS
-- ============================================================
-- Explicit code-point ranges instead of [[:alpha:]]: A-Z, a-z, Latin-1
-- letters (excluding the multiplication and division signs) and Latin
-- Extended-A/B (covers n-tilde, accented vowels, etc.). Whitespace and
-- hyphen are still allowed; digits and punctuation are still rejected.
-- Keep the API-side NAME regex in lockstep with this one.

-- 2. IDENTITY UNIQUENESS (live accounts only)
-- ============================================================
-- One Google/Apple identity -> one account. provider_id is NULL for local
-- accounts, so they are excluded.

-- ============================================================
-- 3. EMAIL: CASE-INSENSITIVE, AND REUSABLE AFTER SOFT DELETE
-- ============================================================
-- The plain UNIQUE constraint is replaced by a partial unique index on
-- lower(email). NOTE: anything using ON CONFLICT (email) must switch to
-- ON CONFLICT (lower(email)) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL, and email lookups
-- should filter deleted_at IS NULL (they almost certainly already do).
